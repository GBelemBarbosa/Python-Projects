1371 "You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a body saving throw, or it takes 1d6 poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move."

1397 "As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. The weapon is engulfed in green flames or is searing white-hot and orange (you choice). On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and green or bright orange (your choice) fire leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to rounddown(spellcasting aspect/2)."

1399 'At 5th Level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + rounddown(spellcasting aspect/2). Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th Level and 17th Level.'
