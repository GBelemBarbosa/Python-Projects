Each of the spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
Magic cards
Transmutation cantrip
Casting time: 1 bonus action
Range: touch
Components: v, s
Duration: 1 minute
You touch one to three playing cards and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the cards by throwing it. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the card, that attacker uses your spellcasting aspect to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d6 + rounddown(your spellcasting aspect/2). Hit or miss, the spell then ends on the card.
If you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any cards still affected by it.

Air Slash
Evocation cantrip
Casting time:	1 action
Range:	120 feet
Components:	S
Duration: Instantaneous
You swing a weapon capable of dealing slashing damage or release a throwing weapon capable of slashing damage, and a blade of air is launched, or the thrown weapon is empowered and propelled by razor sharp winds at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 slashing damage. Objects destroyed and creatures killed by this spell’s damage are cut cleanly. 
This spell’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
Mending
Transmutation cantrip
Casting time: 1 action
Range: touch
Components: v, s, m (two lodestones)
Duration: instantaneous
This spell repairs or partially repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 square foot, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. If the break or tear is larger, you mend it up to 1 square foot, with the rest still unfinished. Whether a corpse or dead organic matter in general is an object depends on the beliefs of the caster, and might even be dependent on how long the creature has been dead.
This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.
Additionally, if enough mending is cast on a larger tear than the area limit for a single use or an object broken into smaller pieces, you eventually are able to mend it, slowly but surely. To do this, however, you might have to succeed on a check as determined by the dm to do the job properly. This check might be artistry or manufacturing to determine if you know the proper form of the original object, or even nature, if you’re trying to repair a statue of a creature, for instance.

The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
Be aware, the verbal component of this spell is not the uttered whisper, but instead a series of incantations akin to any other spell.

Mage hand
Conjuration cantrip
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: v, s
Duration: 1 minute
A spectral, floating hand appears at an unoccupied space you can see within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand is dismissed if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again. The hand isn't a creature and can't be targeted by attacks and magical effects in any way, except to dispel it.
You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial without checks. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it. You can’t use tools with the hand.
If you try to stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature or otherwise retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature with the hand you do so with a maximum modifier of +0 on the dexterity check (including advantage). If the hand is required to make a contested athletics check, it always loses. The hand has an athletics aspect of -10. 
The hand can’t attack, meaningfully use a shield or block attacks, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds. If it tries to move while carrying more than its capacity, it instead doesn't move.

Magical tinkering
Transmutation cantrip
Casting time: 1 action
Range: touch
Components: s, m (varies)
Duration: varies
You touch a non magical object and choose one effect, each one have a different component necessary for it to work, a duration and a target, listed in parenthesis respectively:
• (Half an ounce of wax, 1 hour, an object that can fit in your hand) For 10 seconds you can record and store the surrounding sounds within the object; you can stop the recording at any point, no action required. Afterwards, while a creature touches the object (as an object interaction), it reproduces the sounds in a loop, beginning at any point in time it choses. When you cast this spell, you can forgo the trigger condition, instead having the effect be always active for the duration. Independent of the origin, the sounds reproduced can just vary from a whisper to a loud crowd talking, with louder recorded sounds being muffled to fit the criteria. If the object is destroyed, it stops recording or reproducing.
• (Two ounces of wax, 1 week, a gold object that fits in your hand) When you cast this spell, you specify a fixed amount of time, up to one week. The gold object then remains dormant, recording its surroundings for the specified duration. If the effect ends, for instance because you dismiss it, as specified below, it is dispelled, or at the end of the duration, the object begins to reproduce its contents in order once, and cannot be paused or reproduced again. Independent of the origin, the sounds reproduced can just vary from a whisper to a loud crowd talking, with louder recorded sounds being muffled to fit the criteria. If the object is destroyed, it stops recording or reproducing.
• (A piece of fleece, 5 minutes, a small silver bell) The bell prevents all sound within 1' of where you touched it as long as the bell’s sound is not physically impeded (although it is still silenced by this effect). If the bell’s clapper is impeded, or the bell is muffled with cloth or another material, the effect ends early. When the effect ends on the bell, it reproduces all sound created within the radius once, with the same intensity and in the same order; the bell ringing is one of these sounds. This reproduction is not muffled by physical barriers, and travels as far as it loudless allows it to. If the bell is put in an extradimensional space, the sound originates from that space’s opening (or where it used to be) instead, onto all dimensions it traveled through. If the bell is destroyed at any stage, be it silencing or reproducing sound, it makes a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, which also cannot be muffled.
If the sounds recorded with this spell in any mode are that of an illusion, the creature listening or seeing the recording, respectively, can investigate its authenticity as an action as it would with a normal illusion of that type. The ac is that of the caster of the given illusion, not necessarily yours. For general rules and guidelines for illusions, see the illusion section on the spells folder.
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

Magical fiddling
Transmutation cantrip
Casting time: 1 action
Range: touch
Components: s, m (varies)
Duration: varies
You touch a non magical object and choose one effect, each one have a different component necessary for it to work, a duration and a target, listed in parenthesis respectively:
• (A pinch of phosphorus, 1 hour, any surface) A static visual effect appears on the surface. This effect can be up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes (up to the level of sigils and emblems, pictographic in nature, yet detailed) or a mixture of these elements, as you like,  within an area of approximately a round shield. Whenever tapped by a creature (as an object interaction) the markings appear or disappear, depending on its current state. 
• (A pinch of nitrate, 20 minutes, spherical crystal bead or lens) You may choose to hold the object and capture a perfect frozen image of what you see, and when the object is tapped (as an object interaction) the image appears or disappears. Alternatively, you can record up to 2 continuous minutes of what you see; you can stop the recording at any point, no action required. While the object is tapped by a creature (as an object interaction) it reproduces the images in a loop, beginning at any point in time it choses. When you cast this spell, you can forgo the trigger condition, instead having the effect be always active for the duration.
• (A embroidered ribbon or a pair of golden rings, 1 hour, any object) You touch the object to a surface or another object, sticking them together. In order to separate them, a creature must succeed on an AC +4 athletics check, or 12 pounds of non-creature originated force is applied.
If the images recorded with this spell in any mode are that of an illusion, the creature listening or seeing the recording, respectively, can investigate its authenticity as an action as it would with a normal illusion of that type. The ac is that of the caster of the given illusion, not necessarily yours. For general rules and guidelines for illusions, see the illusion section on the spells folder.
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
