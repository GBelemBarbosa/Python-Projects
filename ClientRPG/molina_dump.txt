Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.\n\nYour familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack or use the help action to attack, but it can take other actions as normal.\n\nWhen the familiar drops to 0 pcn, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.\n\nWhile your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically (the telepathic communication just works from you to your familiar, but not the other way around). Your familiar obeys your commands as best it can, and can convey to you its basic mood and intent. However, it can't attune to or activate magical items. It also can only normally do some checks or sometimes use the help action or be helped by other creatures in athletics, acrobatics, nature, and animal handling, as long as you respect the physical capabilities of your familiar. It can also do awareness checks even to determine a humanoid’s true intentions, and it can not use the help action or be helped by other creatures for these checks. Other uses may be allowed by the dm as long as you give him a valid explanation as to why, such as your familiar helping you in convincing or trustworthiness checks by being affable towards the target.\n\nAdditionally, while your familiar is within 100 feet of you, as a bonus action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has, losing your own if they aren’t inherent (those that don’t target your body, such as a spell,  or depend on your position, such as an aura or item that must be on your person) or if they are dependent on your physiology, such as keen hearing, but using the highest between your stats regarding soul and mind checks. You can’t use the help action between yourself and your familiar in this state, but can be helped or help other creatures as normal, as long as you respect the physical capabilities of your familiar’s body. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, effects and conditions cast and imposed in your body don’t affect your perception and capability to perform activities in this state (but are not ended), while the ones affecting your familiar affect you both as normal, and they keep their original individual rules and durations. Any inherent (same definition) mental resistance or immunity (such as immunity to charm effects) that you have still has an effect on you in this state.\n\nAs an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits you to summon it. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever.  As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. Its reappearance makes a popping sound, audible from as far away as 100 feet.\n\nYou can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, choose one of these extra abilities:\n\nAs a bonus action while the familiar is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any space of your choice within 100 feet of you instead. If the familiar would reappear inside an occupied space, it stays dismissed. Its reappearance doesn’t cause any sound.\n\nWhen you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it.

The giant salamander has to keep its skin moist or it will take one level of exhaustion for each half hour it remains in a dry climate unattended. It takes about twice the amount of water that a medium creature needs to keep the salamander hydrated, and another creature have to spend an action roughly every half hour to moisten the salamander's skin if no body of waters where the salamander can douse itself are nearby. In extremely hot and dry climates (such as the elemental plane of fire), the DM might rule that the salamander needs even more water and attention.")]}
