A good rule of thumb when it is unclear whether or not a creature would qualify as a instance is to cogitate what the caster would conclude while looking at it, based on its knowledge of the world and of specific elements involved, ideologies and worldviews, and interpretations and suppositions, given what the it can perceive. That being said, disguises and illusions may be effective at concealing the creature’s true identity. These points capture the locations of the creatures only at the instant the spell was cast.

Disguise self
1 bso illusion
Casting time: 1 action
Range: self
Components: v, s
Duration: 1 hour
You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an investigation check against your spell as. For general rules and guidelines on illusions, see the illusion section on the spells folder.

Find familiar
1 bso conjuration (ritual)
Casting time: 1 hour
Range: 10 feet
Components: v, s, m (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)
Duration: instantaneous
You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: octopus, owl, raven, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack or use the help action to attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
When the familiar drops to 0 pcn, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.
While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically (the telepathic communication just works from you to your familiar, but not the other way around). Your familiar obeys your commands as best it can, and can convey to you its basic mood and intent. However, it can't attune to or activate magical items. It also can only normally do some checks or sometimes use the help action or be helped by other creatures in athletics, acrobatics, nature, and animal handling, as long as you respect the physical capabilities of your familiar. It can also do awareness checks even to determine a humanoid’s true intentions, and it can not use the help action or be helped by other creatures for these checks. Other uses may be allowed by the dm as long as you give him a valid explanation as to why, such as your familiar helping you in convincing or trustworthiness checks by being affable towards the target.
Additionally, while your familiar is within 100 feet of you, as a bonus action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has, losing your own if they aren’t inherent (those that don’t target your body, such as a spell,  or depend on your position, such as an aura or item that must be on your person) or if they are dependent on your physiology, such as keen hearing, but using the highest between your stats regarding soul and mind checks. You can’t use the help action between yourself and your familiar in this state, but can be helped or help other creatures as normal, as long as you respect the physical capabilities of your familiar’s body. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, effects and conditions cast and imposed in your body don’t affect your perception and capability to perform activities in this state (but are not ended), while the ones affecting your familiar affect you both as normal, and they keep their original individual rules and durations. Any inherent (same definition) mental resistance or immunity (such as immunity to charm effects) that you have still has an effect on you in this state.
As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits you to summon it. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever.  As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. Its reappearance makes a popping sound, audible from as far away as 100 feet. 
You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.
When you cast this spell, choose one of these extra abilities:
As a bonus action while the familiar is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any space of your choice within 100 feet of you instead. If the familiar would reappear inside an occupied space, it stays dismissed. Its reappearance doesn’t cause any sound.
When you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your appropriate attack modifier for the roll.

Silent image
1 bso illusion
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: v, s, m (a bit of fleece)
Duration: focusing, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.
You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. You can also use your action to animate the image within the constraints of its form, making it raise its arm, move its mouth, jump, etc. You can’t make fire appear out of its mouth or make it be beheaded if those elements weren’t in the image from the beginning. To make these more elaborate changes, or even morph the image into something new entirely, such a man turning into a wolf or demon, you can recast the spell without making the image disappear, seemingly from one to the other.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful investigation check against your spell as. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image. For general rules and guidelines for illusions, see the illusion section on the spells folder.

Sleep
1 bso enchantment
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: v, s, m (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)
Duration: 1 minute
This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8, the total is how many pcn of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current pcn (ignoring unconscious creatures).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current pcn, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s current pcn from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest current pcn. A creature’s current pcn must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell, but still subtract pcn from the total, and you don’t know why the creature wasn’t affected, but can deduce that it is immune.
Kicker. When you cast this spell using 2 or more shards, roll an additional 2d8 for each shard above 1.

Snare
1 bso abjuration
Casting time: 1 minute
Range: touch
Components: v, s, m (30 feet of cord or rope, which is consumed by the spell)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
While you cast this spell, you use the cord or rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on a flat surface within your reach. When you finish casting, the cord or rope disappears to become a magical trap.
The trap is nearly invisible and requires a successful investigation check against your spell as to be found.
The trap triggers when a small or larger creature moves into the area protected by the spell. The triggering creature must succeed on a senses saving throw or fall prone and be hoisted into the air until it hangs upside down 3 feet above the protected surface, where it is restrained.
The restrained creature can make a senses saving throw with disadvantage (anterior type) at the end of each of its turns and ends the restrained effect on a success.

Tenser's floating disk
1 bso conjuration (ritual)
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: v, s, m (a drop of mercury)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter, that floats 3 feet above the lowest elevation of your body in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 700 pounds of force (approx. 7303.5 N) pushing straight down on its surface. If more force is exerted upon it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground. The disk can’t be reoriented, and the only surface that is tangible is its top, meaning it can pass through objects and walls. An object cohesive in regards to itself (in a single piece) partially inside of the disk can’t interact with its surface, and objects on top of it may be pushed off of it in the process if their momentum isn’t enough to remove the obstacle. The surface of the disk has friction comparable to rough rock. 
The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you in a straight line so that it remains within 20 feet of you at the same relative height with a movement speed of up to 10 ft. and acceleration of 1 G (meaning that if 350 pounds are on top of it, the disk’s own movement don’t cause the force on top of it to exceed 500 pounds of force even when moving vertically). While within 5 feet of the disk, you or creatures you designate when you cast this spell can also gently guide it horizontally within the 20 feet around you by expending all your movement to move it at its normal speed, while still within 5 feet of it throughout the movement.  
A non-incapacitated creature can perform an acrobatics check with AC determined by the DM to move up to 5ft. out of the disk’s (and whatever is on top of it) path in a direction of its choice.
If you move more than 100 feet from the disk, the spell ends.

If your target is a construct or an earth elemental the bonus thunder damage increases by 1d8 and it has disadvantage on the Strength saving throw.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

Until the spell ends, you make performance checks with advantage (anterior type), as long as they are not to impersonate others or hide your mannerisms. In addition, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to beguile one creature you choose within 30 feet of you that can see you and hear the music. The creature must make a soul saving throw. If you or your companions are attacking it, the creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes friendly to you for as long as it can hear the music and for 1 hour thereafter. You make simulation and convincing checks against creatures made friendly by this spell with advantage (anterior type).

Unseen servant
1 bso conjuration (ritual)
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: v, s, m (a piece of string and a bit of wood)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, medium force (that is treated as an object) that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. It performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has aa +0, 1 pcn, and a body stat of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 pcn, the spell ends.
Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet in any direction (including up or down in the air) and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine, as long as you point it to the right direction and guide it thoroughly, i.e. clear to follow step-by-step instructions that don’t allow the space for any creative interpretations that the servant lacks. However, it can't attune to or activate magical items. It also can only do checks or use the help action or be helped by other creatures in athletics, and acrobatics, as long as you respect its physical capabilities. It is utterly oblivious to its surroundings' changes and details, and can’t do awareness or investigation checks or use the help action for these checks; if you want your servant to pick up wood in the forest, you have to point out what to pick up, for instance, since it can’t find it for himself.
If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

Duration: instantaneous
You invoke a rite, entreating a boon from nearby spirits. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following rites, the target of which must be within 10 feet of you throughout the casting. 
Rite of elegy. You speak the name of a dead humanoid, and imbue a creature or object precious to it in life—such as a loved one or treasured belonging—with nostalgia. If the dead humanoid became an undead with unfinished business, such as a ghost, spectre, or poltergeist, and is within 1 mile of you, it must succeed on a soul saving throw or spend its turns moving as close to the target as it can for 1 hour or until it takes damage. 
Rite of fertility. One willing creature you touch is imbued with life. Any attempts the affected creature makes to conceive a child within the next 24 hours are successful. If the creature is pregnant, the pregnancy cannot fail or be terminated without the creature's consent, and any disease affecting the creature will not harm their offspring. 
Rite of warding. One homestead or small building is sheltered by a protective blessing until you leave the building or fall unconscious. As part of casting the spell, you touch a number of thresholds, such as doors, windows, or other entryways. For the duration, each threshold has resistance to all damage, and any fey, fiend, or undead that attempts to enter must succeed on a soul saving throw or be unable to willingly pass through until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. 
Rite of wild sanctuary. One animal you touch with a mind stat of 6 or lower is shepherded by gentle spirits. The animal has a +20 bonus (anterior type) to all checks made to evade capture and will be led to the nearest source of enough food, water, and shelter to sustain them until they find a safe habitat to live in.
Vengeful spirit
1 bso conjuration
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: v, s
Duration: instantaneous
You beckon a spirit to your side, feeding it a vengeful rage. The spirit rushes towards a creature or object within range, seeking to destroy it. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 necrotic damage. Hit or miss, the spirit then vanishes. 
If the target has attacked you or targeted you with a harmful spell since the end of your last turn, the spirit's lust for vengeance is set aflame. If the attack hits, the spirit hounds the target a moment longer, preventing it from taking reactions until the start of its next turn. 
Kicker: when you cast this spell using 2 or more shards, the damage increases by 1d8 for each shard above 1.
Nature’s brand
1 bso evocation
Casting time: 1 bonus action
Range: self
Components: v
Duration: focusing, up to 1 minute
You coat your weapon in magical light. The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack during the duration, the attack deals an extra 1d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice) and the target must make a soul saving throw. On a failed save, the target is branded by that energy. For the duration, whenever the branded creature takes damage-like of that type, it takes 1d6 extra damage and can make an additional soul saving throw, ending the spell on a success. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses its action to rub off the brand, the spell ends early. Kicker. 
When you cast this spell using 2 or more shards, the initial extra damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d6 for each shard above 1.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: v, s, m (a drop of blood)
Duration: Instantaneous
Choose an unoccupied 20-foot square within range - note that the area must have solid earth beneath it; this spell fails if cast on the upper floor of a building. This spell then causes one pile of humanoid bones to rise out of the ground within that square. If you cast this spell within a burial place such as a graveyard, mausoleum or barrow, 1d4 piles of bones are exhumed instead of 1. The ground itself is not changed or disturbed by this spell; the bones simply appear out of the ground.
Arcane ablation
1 bso transmutation
Casting time: 1 action
Range: touch
Components: v, s
Duration: 1 hour
You touch a piece of worn armor or clothing and imbue it with magic. The creature wearing the imbued item gains 4 temporary pcn for the duration.

Fall 
1 bso transmutation
Casting time: 1 action
Range: self
Components: v, s

You alter gravity for yourself, causing you to reorient which way is down for you until the end of your turn. You can pick any direction to fall as if under the effect of gravity, falling up to 500 feet before the spell ends. If you collide with something during this time, you take falling damage as normal, but you can control your fall as you could under normal conditions by holding onto objects or move along a surface according to your new orientation as normal until your turn ends and gravity returns to normal.

1 bso transmutation
Casting time: 1 action

Components: v, s
Duration: focusing, up to 10 minutes
You touch a piece of ammunition or weapon with the thrown property imbuing it with the property of seeking its target. When a ranged attack roll is made with that weapon, the attacker can add your spellcasting aspect (anterior type) to the roll. If that makes the value on the die a 20 or more, the attack is a critical hit as if a 20 was rolled. After making the attack roll, the spell ends.

Animate weapon
1 bso transmutation
Casting time: | action
Range: touch
Components:v, s
Duration: focusing, up to 1 hour
This spell creates a flying weapon. Choose a nonmagical simple or martial melee weapon in range that isn’t being worn or carried. The weapon animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until the creature is reduced to 0 pcn. At the end of the creature's turn, if it is more than 30 feet from you, it returns to being a nonmagical weapon. As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 30 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any number of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the construct continues to follow it until its task is complete. An animated weapon is a construct with the same statistics as a flying sword, but deals the same damage as the weapon animated and loses its +4 to hit if you are not proficient with that weapon. The dm has the creature's statistics. 
Kicker. If you cast this spell using 3 or more shards, you can animate an additional weapon for each two shards above 1.

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain the control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.
Kicker. When you cast this spell using 2 or more shards, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead body parts for each shard above 2.
