Arcane Bombardment
2 bso Abjuration
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Before the spell ends, when you cast a 2nd-level spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can target a second creature in range with the same spell.

Witness protection
2 bso Illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Focusing, up to 1 hour
You make one creature you touch look and sound different until the spell ends. This spell affects the target's appearance and voice, but not its clothing, armor, weapons, or other belongings on its person. The target can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change the target's body type, so the target must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to the target's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the target's head and hair. If you use this spell to cause the target to appear thinner than they are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch them would bump into them while it was seemingly still in midair.
To discern that the target is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect the target's appearance and must succeed on an Investigation check against your spell save AS. For general rules and guidelines on illusions, see the illusion section on the spells folder.
If you focus on this spell for its entire duration, the illusion becomes permanent. A remove curse spell ends this effect.

If you cast the spell two or more times before taking a long rest, you must succeed on an AC -10 body saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.
Kicker. When you cast this spell using 3 or more shards, the range of vision increases by 10 feet for each shard above 2.

Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
A circular portal appears at your location and intercepts the attack, teleporting it through to a matching portal directly behind the attacker in its space.

The attacker makes the attack roll against itself, excluding any intermediate and posterior bonuses still applicable it chooses or expended during the triggering attack, but keeping all the anterior type bonuses still applicable (for instance, anterior type advantage on the attack remains, but if said advantage was only for targeting you, it is no longer applicable). If it hits, the attacker becomes subject to the attack’s inherent effects as normal, but no other effects that trigger on the hit from other sources unless they were triggered on you, are still applicable and the source's controller has no way of choosing to stop it.
You must be able to see the attacker, and it must be within 60 feet for the spell to function. The portals close as soon as the attack is finished, without causing any direct harm themselves.

Duration: focusing, up to 1 minute
You befuddle the mind of a target creature you can see within range, swapping the position of two things you and them can see that are of the same size and category (for example, two medium creatures or two gargantuan buildings). The target perceives the two things as being swapped and rationalizes this occurrence as a kind of magical effect or simply confusion on its part, and acts accordingly. Sounds, smells and other stimuli are also perceived as being from the new positions, and strange occurrences, such as creatures seemingly attacking nothingness, floating in midair (if the original is lifted or sitting on a chair, for instance), or some instances of overlapping objects caused by the non-perfect match of dimensions and movement not fit for the swapped locations, are dismissed as hallucinations. Creatures immune to the charmed condition aren’t affected by this spell.
Each time the creature interacts with, attacks, or is attacked by a swapped target, it can make a mind saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
If this spell’s material component was something from the target creature, you don’t need to see the creature for the casting and the spell’s range becomes 1 mile.

As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 pcn, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
You are limited in the actions you can perform by the nature of your new form, and you can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

Components: V, S

Choose a point on the ground within range that you can see. A geyser with a base of 5 feet by 5 feet and a height of up to 10 feet erupts from this point. If a creature sized large or smaller is on top of this area, it must make a Senses saving throw. Objects not worn or carried of the same size categories are also affected, but if only partially on the area, they may be only pushed aside or topple, at the dm’s discretion. If it succeeds, a creature moves to the closest unoccupied space of its choice. If the creature fails this saving throw, however, it takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, is rendered prone, and is carried to the top of the geyser. If the creature or object collides with something before reaching its maximum height, such as a ceiling, that isn’t being lifted as well, it takes an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is considered restrained while on the top of the geyser and next to the obstruction.
The geyser blocks line of sight, and creatures within or at the top of the geyser are both swimming and in difficult terrain.

Range: 60 feet
Components: S, M (a drop of oil and a pinch of incense)
Duration: focusing, up to 24 hours
Targeting a simple non-magical mechanism within range, you awaken the benign spirit of that machine. For this purpose, a simple mechanism is something no more complex than the hinges on a door, a compass, a scale, a rope and pulley, a ship’s wheel, the wheels on a wagon, or the latch on a window.
For the duration of this spell, the machine spirit responds to any commands you give it as a bonus action while you are within 120 feet of it, as if a creature with athletics and resilience aspects of +22 was operating that machine. You can tell the spirit to open or close a door, window, or unlocked chest; lower or raise a rope in a pulley; or weigh down a scale, as examples.
The spirit will take no actions that would bring obvious harm to their machine, such as slamming a window so hard it shatters. Further, a spirit can be commanded to follow a certain course of action, such as only opening a door for specified creatures, and then closing it behind them.
This machine spirit is invisible, intangible, intargetable and immune to all damage, but destroying their mechanism causes the spirit to die, and the spell to end. If this spell is cast on the same mechanism every day for one year, the spell’s effects become permanent and no longer require focusing, though you can still only command a machine spirit while within 120 feet of its mechanism.

A creature affected by this spell is unable to take reactions and cannot move more than 10 feet away from the point indicated. Any forced movement that would move the creature out of this radius instead moves the creature to its edge or to the nearest unoccupied space outside the edge, but locking it in place until there is an unoccupied space on the edge, at which point the creature snaps back to that space.
On its turn, the creature can attempt to break the chains by using an action to make an Athletics check with disadvantage (anterior type) against your spell save as, ending this spell on a success.
Kicker. When you cast this spell using 4 or more shards or more, this spell can target a creature of Huge size or smaller, or Gargantuan or smaller with 6 shards or more.
Conjure Trap
2 bso conjuration

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 120 feet
Components: S, M (a trip wire and a small handful of cogs)
Duration: 8 hours
You conjure a trap in a 10 foot cube at a location you see that you choose within range. This trap can be your choice of either a flame trap or a spike trap. At your DM’s option, you may be able to make other types of traps with this spell, but they have the final say on what this spell can and cannot make.
Additionally, you decide when you cast this spell if the trap triggers when a creature enters the trap’s area, when a door or chest in or adjacent to the area is opened, or when a similar condition is met that you specify with your DM. The trap cannot discern friendly creatures from hostile creatures, nor can it tell creatures apart by type or any other characteristics.
When the trap is triggered, creatures in its area must make a senses saving throw. If a creature fails, it takes 3d8 fire or piercing damage, if the trap is a flame or a spike trap, respectively. If the creature succeeds, it takes half this damage. You know immediately that the trap has been triggered, and this spell ends.
The trap is nearly invisible, and creatures that suspect a trap is in an area can make an Investigation check against your spell save as to attempt to find it. A located trap can be disarmed by a creature adjacent to its area with a successful Arcana or Thieves’Tools check made against your spell save as. A successful disarm check or a casting of dispel magic (or similar) ends this spell, but you do not inherently know that the trap was disarmed.
Kicker. When cast with 3 or more shards, you choose to either increase area of the trap’s cube by 5 feet, or increase the damage it deals by 1d8, for each shard above 2. You can choose individually, for each shard above 2, which of these benefits applies to the trap.
In addition to these benefits, a trap created with5 shards or more can instead have a duration of permanent. Such traps are still removed when they are triggered, disarmed, or affected by dispel magic or similar. You cannot have more than five permanent traps at any one time, and conjuring a new permanent trap after reaching this limit dispels the oldest permanent trap you conjured with this spell.

You speak aloud, demanding a boon from one of the darkest planes. You instantly replicate the effects of any spell of 1 base shard output (at their base output) with a casting time of 1 action or bonus action that inherently deals damage, or any cantrip from any spell list. Each time you cast this spell, roll a d20. If the result is 1, you are struck by an unholy force, reducing you to 0 pcn and causing you to fail your first and second death saving throws immediately after the spell is cast. If you are struck down a second time due to this spell before you finish a long rest, you die and cannot be resurrected by a spell cast using less than 8 base shards.

When you cast this spell using 4 shards, you can replicate a spell of 3 base shard output, and the threshold for being struck down increases to a result of 3 or lower.

You whisper a phrase into the mind of the target, unknown to you but clear and terrifying to them. Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage (anterior type) on all checks, attack rolls, and saving throws involving your target or actions it has taken. During this time, the target has disadvantage (anterior type) on all checks and attack rolls involving you or actions you have taken. At the DM discretion, the target may act upon its fear or suspicion that you uncovered its secret (maybe ordering your death, telling its confidant, or running away to hide in shame or fear of the consequences, or simply panicking). The target then forgets that it heard you whisper in its mind and rationalizes or dismisses any behavioral outcomes that sprouted from this spell (maybe believing it was all its imagination of a hypothetical scenario, or that people that try to make him remember are playing a prank on him or conspiring to make it reveal the secret or that they imagined the events simultaneously). Targets that are immune to being frightened are immune to this effect. 
Kicker: when you cast this spell using 3 or more shards, you can choose one additional target per shard above 2.

Duration: focusing, up to 10 minutes
A favorite of torturous fiends and hungry fishermen.
You conjure three barbed harpoons of intricately twisted silver. They float in the air above your head for the spell’s duration, and fade when it ends. When you cast the spell, and as an action on each of your subsequent turns, you can make a ranged spell attack to hurl a harpoon at a target within 90 feet of you. If you miss, the harpoon fades. If you hit, the target takes 2d6 piercing damage and must make a senses saving throw. If they fail, the harpoon lodges in their flesh. While a creature has been skewered by a harpoon, its speed is halved, and you can use a bonus action to cause an invisible chain to pull taut, pulling the creature 10 feet towards you for each harpoon lodged in it. 
The target can use an action to pull any number of harpoons out, taking 3d6 necrotic damage for each harpoon removed and causing the harpoon to fade. Once all three harpoons have faded, the spell ends.

The target retains its alignment and personality, though its mannerisms may be slightly affected by the nature of the beast. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The target's gear melds into the new form. Effects previously on the creature that can’t target or don’t have an effect on the new form are suspended (but are not ended) while the transformation persists.   The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. The spell ends early if the target is reduced to 0 pcn, or if they end the spell on their turn (no action required).

You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.
While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the ac to break it or pick any locks on it increases by -20.

Casting time: 1 minute
Range: self
Components: v, s, m (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)
Duration: instantaneous
By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The dm chooses from the following possible omens:
• Weal, for good results
• Woe, for bad results
• Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
• Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad
The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The dm makes this roll in secret.

You coalesce out of thin air magical darkness that spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.
If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.
If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2 bso or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

Detect thoughts
2 bso divination
Casting time: 1 action
Range: self
Components: v, s, m (a copper piece)
Duration: focusing, up to 1 minute
For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can direct your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an mind stat of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.
You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a mind saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates, or evil intentions and plans). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target immediately registers that you are probing into its mind and monitoring its thoughts (but not for how long you were learning its surface thoughts, or even that you did learn its surface thoughts, if it doesn’t know about this spell), and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make a mind check contested by your spell as; if it succeeds, the spell ends.
Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.
You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an mind stat of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.
Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.

Each creature in that area must make a senses saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the dust devil must make a body saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.
As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or small gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.
Kicker. When you cast this spell using 3 or more shards, the damage increases by 1d8 for each shard above 2.

Enlarge/reduce
2 bso transmutation
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: v, s, m (a pinch of powdered iron)
Duration: focusing, up to 1 minute
You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object cohesive in regards to itself (in a single piece) not larger than 500 cubic feet that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a body saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.
If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.
Enlarge. The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category – from medium to large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage (anterior type) on body checks and saving throws. The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attack with them deal 1d4 extra damage.
Reduce. The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category – from medium to small, for example. If there isn’t enough leeway for the target to halve its size, the creature or object attains the minimum possible size possible. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage (anterior type) on body checks and saving throws. The target’s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).

On a failed save, the target has disadvantage (anterior type) on awareness checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.

Healing Spirit
2 bso conjuration
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Focusing, up to 1 minute
You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. It can be a totemic ethereal figure of your belief system, a tree of light that represents the one that safeguards and blesses your land, the spirit of a mythical  holy figure or half animals half spirits guardians of the wild. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit is always translucent and doesn't meaningfully block view or produce illumination, although the DM might rule otherwise.
Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 pcn to that creature (no action required). The spirit can’t heal constructs or undead.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the Spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + rounddown(spellcasting aspect/2) (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

Casting time: 10 minutes
Range: 30 feet
Components: v, s
Duration: instantaneous
You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the Steed takes on the form of a Medium or Large quadrupedal beast that you have seen before with a CR of 1/2 or lower that does not have a climbing, flying, or swimming speed. Examples include: elk, camel, giant goat, mastiff, pony, or warhorse. The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has a mind of 5 or less, its mind becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.
When the steed drops to 0 pcn, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its pcn maximum.
While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.
At Higher Levels.

Examples include: dire wolf, griffon, pegasus, peryton, polar bear, or rhinoceros.

Casting time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet

You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight or behind at most 5 ft. of material, such as a door. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you have advantage (anterior type) on investigation checks to find and learn the general nature of the danger posed by each trap you sense.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range.
When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

Locate object
2 bso divination
Casting time: 1 action
Range: self
Components: v, s, m (a forked twig)
Duration: focusing, up to 10 minutes
Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object’s location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement. 
The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close – within 30 feet – at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.
This spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.
Even if you don’t get a pinpoint, you can keep focusing on this spell until the target enters the range. While focusing in this spell, you can only move with one fourth of your movement speed. If you dislocate (such as pushed, carried or teleported) more than half your movement speed during a turn, the spells end.

Locate creature (Locate animals or plants)
2 bso divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self, touch
Components: V, S, M (a magnet dipped and a bit of fur from a bloodhound)
Duration: focusing, up to 1 hour
Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. The magnet material component of this spell points to it as if it were a compass as long as that creature is within 1 mile of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement in your mind.
The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a bear or oak tree), that is also a plant or beast, so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a *polymorph* spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature. 
You can also touch an object as part of casting this spell to identify the aura of the last creature that touched it. Make an awareness or Investigation check against an AC of - (6 + double the number of days since the last contact occurred). On a success, you learn the creature's type and the spell resolves targeting that creature. On a failure, the spell ends.
This spell can't locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.
Even if you don’t get a pinpoint, you can keep focusing on this spell until the target enters the range. While focusing on this spell, you can only move with one fourth of your movement speed. If you dislocate (such as pushed, carried or teleported) more than half your movement speed during a turn, the spells end.

Immovable object
2 bso transmutation (dunamancy: graviturgy)
Casting time: 1 action
Range: touch
Components: v, s, m (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes))
Duration: 1 hour
You touch an object cohesive in regards to itself (in a single piece) that weighs no more than 10 pounds and isn’t being worn and cause it to become magically fixed in place. The DM might require a spell attack roll to affect an object that is being carried. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can move the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute.
If the object is fixed in the air, it can hold up to 4,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the object to fall. Otherwise, a creature can use an action to make an athletics check against your spell as. On a success, the creature can move the object up to 10 feet.
Kicker. If you cast this spell using 4 shards, the as to move the object increases by -10, it can carry up to 8,000 pounds of weight, and the duration increases to 24 hours. If you cast this spell using 6 shards, the as to move the object increases by -20, it can carry up to 20,0 00 pounds of weight, and the effect is permanent until dispelled.

Magic mouth
2 bso illusion (ritual)
Casting time: 1 minute
Range: 30 feet
Components: v, s, m (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled
You record and implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. As long as you are on the same plane of existence as the spell, you instantly know when it triggers and exactly which instance of this spell it was. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.
The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it. This 30 feet sense has no special properties such as darkvision, blindsight, capability of seeing in magical darkness or hear through magical silence etc. A good rule of thumb when it is unclear whether or not an event would qualify as a trigger is to cogitate what the caster would conclude if in the same situation, based on its knowledge of the world and of specific elements involved, ideologies and worldviews, and interpretations and suppositions, given what the sensor can perceive. The triggering might be affected by illusory effects, such as an illusory item that is involved on the trigger, such as an illusory sword on a condition of being armed.

You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range.

On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

Mirror image
2 bso illusion
Casting time: 1 action
Range: self
Components: v, s
Duration: 1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s duration, roll a d6 for each of your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is targeted instead of you. The duplicate has an AA equal to your current AA, and you can add modifiers to your AA as if you were the target of the attack to also apply those modifiers to the duplicate’s roll against being hit, expending resources as necessary (if they are used in the duplicate’s roll) and keeping the modifiers to your AA after the attack is resolved if their sources have a duration other than instantaneous (such as the shield spell). If the duplicate is hit, it disappears, and effects that trigger on hits on you (such as hellish rebuke) don’t trigger. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects, and can’t be targeted by spells or attacks. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see (blinded or otherwise), if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

Nystul's magic aura
2 bso illusion
Casting time: 1 action
Range: touch
Components: v, s, m (a small square of silk)
Duration: 24 hours
You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.
When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.
False aura. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.
Mask. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s divine sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.

Pass without trace
2 bso abjuration
Casting time: 1 action
Range: self
Components: v, s, m (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)
Duration: focusing, up to 1 hour
A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, while in this aura, you and creatures you choose while within 30 feet of you have a +20 bonus (anterior type) to stealth checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage: footprints are erased, plants regrow or reform over trails and broken branches decompose, etc.
Phantasmal force
2 bso illusion
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: v, s, m (a bit of fleece)
Duration: focusing, up to 1 minute
You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a mind saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature, and is undetected by truesight and blindsight. The phantasm can be moved by the target and it can feel the phantasm pushing back on itself, but the phantasm doesn’t truly offer support to the target, such as for it to lean on or walk across. For instance, a blocked helmet with no visage can be made around the target's head and it feels as though it is heavy to it, and also moves along with the target as it moves as if it was being pushed, offering illusory resistance to the movement, but it can’t truly separate the target’s head from a wall it stumbles upon.
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an investigation check against your spell as. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. 
Unlike other illusory effects, the lack of true support from the phantasm when pushed against doesn't cause the target to realize the illusion. While a target is affected by the spell, the target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall; it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 2d8 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

Casting time: 1 action
Range: touch
Components: v, s, m (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)
Duration: 1 hour
You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.
The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.
Spells and magical effects can’t cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope. The entrance blocks spells and effects that mention blockage from 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood and other material based barriers, such as locate creatures and detect magic, or that work only while on the same plane or within a certain range.  Any creature, objects or points within the space cannot be targeted by anything outside of it, and vice versa. Similarly, the space is excluded from the areas affected by spells. The space is considered occupied by effects outside of it, and vice versa.
Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. When the entrance closes, it ejects matter that is partially on both sides (passing through the opening) out.

Suggestion
2 bso enchantment
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: v, m (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
Duration: focusing, up to 8 hours
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
The target must make a mind saving throw. On a failed save, it purses the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t preformed. Whether the triggering condition is met or not is based on your senses and interpretations, therefore what you don’t have a way of knowing can’t trigger the effect, and the triggering might be affected by a confused state or illusory effects, such as a pond that you believe you fell on, but is actually an illusion.
If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

You weave a clouding veil over the mind of one creature you touch.

Warding bond
2 bso abjuration
Casting time: 1 action
Range: touch
Components: v, s, m (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and target must wear for the duration)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends.
While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a -2 bonus to aa and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage. Otherwise the original damage receiver continues to be the target of any side-effects that damage would induce on the original target (anything besides the triggering damage itself).
The spell ends if you drop to 0 pcn or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.

Web
2 bso conjuration
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: v, s, m (a bit of spiderweb)
Duration: focusing, up to 1 hour
You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.
If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a senses saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make an athletics check against your spell as. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

Wristpocket

You flick your wrist, causing one object in your hand to vanish. The object, which only you can be holding and can weigh no more than 5 pounds, is transported to an extradimensional space, where it remains for the duration.
Until the spell ends, you can use your action to summon the object to your free hand, and you can use your action to return the object to the extradimensional space. An object still in the pocket plane when the spell ends appears in your space, at your feet.

Calling
2 bso conjuration (ritual) 
Casting time: 1 action
Range: touch
Components: s, m (a compass)
Duration: focusing, up to 1 hour
An object cohesive in regards to itself (in a single piece) you touch becomes linked to you. The DM might require a spell attack roll to affect an object that is being worn or carried. As an action while within 30 ft. of the object and you have a free hand, you can call it (which is imperceptible), making the object return to a free hand.
Spell lists. Wizard
Zone of truth
2 bso enchantment
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: v, s
Duration: 10 minutes
You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a soul saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. They can still lie with their body, such as pointing a wrong direction or nodding affirmatively when the truth would be a negative. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
Most affected creatures become aware of the effect (but not sure about it’s full extensions and their options to bypass it, such as the body exception, unless they recognize the spell by their own, deduce it with previous information or experiments to answer its suspictions and test the fine print limits) when they try to tell its first lie and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie or they can be evasive in its answers within the boundaries of the truth. A creature may also be slow to understand what is really happening to it and try several times to lie before understanding its conundrum.
